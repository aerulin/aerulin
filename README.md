Hi, welcome to my Github! 👋

I am a tech savvy and code enthusiast. My code journey started when I onboarded Le Wagon in Lausanne in 2021.
This has been the start of a new adventure that I hope will continue for a long time!

The first project we built with my team at Le Wagon was to test our skills. 
=> Share-my-Toothbrush 🪥 is a web plateform enabling users to share their Toothbrush. Yes. New or 🤢used🤢.

With the same team, we build as our final project a culture discovery app.
=> Treasure-Mapp 📍 is a web app to discover the culture and history of your city through a game made of challenges and competition. Who wants to be the 🥇best🥇? 

The first level of code has been unlocked with Ruby on Rails, HTML, JS and CSS. And now: 
<br>
<br>
👍 improve Treasure Mapp and <strong>adapt</strong> it into an Android and iOs app <br>

🧑‍🎨 transform a few ideas I have into MVPs <br>

🚀 onboard new <strong>challenges</strong> in a start-up, scale-up or established company <br>

🧑‍🏫 continue <strong>learning</strong> and consolidate my coding skillset <br>
